# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis
This project explores and analyzes customer churn — a business metric representing customers who stop using a service. Churn analysis helps companies reduce revenue loss by identifying customer segments with high churn risk and deriving actionable insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to highlight key churn drivers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand which customer attributes are linked to higher churn risk.
- Extract meaningful patterns through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Present insights to support data-driven retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

Typical churn datasets contain variables such as customer demographic info, account details, service usage, and churn labels (Yes/No).

Example features often include:

- `Gender`, `Age`, `Tenure`
- `ContractType`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- `ServicesUsed` (e.g., Internet, Phone)
- `Churn` — target variable indicating whether the customer exited the service

## 📈 Analysis Workflow

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Studied churn rates across demographics (e.g., age groups). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Investigated relationships between churn and billing/contract patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### 2. **Visualizations**
- Bar charts, histograms, and correlation plots to highlight patterns.
- Plots showing churn distribution across customer segments.

*(Include visual highlights or images in your README if available.)*

## 🔍 Key Insights

> Replace with your results from the notebook.

- **Customer Tenure:** Short-tenure customers churn more often than long-tenure ones.
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates vs. annual plans.
- **Service Usage:** Specific service types correlate with higher churn in certain segments.
